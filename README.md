Create a Base theme


The purpose of this project is to start creating a standard theme. So it can later be implemented into a Premium Theme. Will be created using the Wordpress.org Theme Hand Book.

There are two folders in this project, one that contains the files for the Base theme (wpTheme) and the other that holds the files for a  child theme that we will be implementing as long as the parent theme.

Source for the base theme:
https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/

Source for the child theme:
https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/child-themes/
